# Polygon-Area-Calculator
This applet allows the user to manipulate a square into any valid 3 or 4 sided polygon by dragging & dropping its vertex points to change the polygon's shape. When the vertex is repositioned, the area of the polygon, angle measurements and side lengths are calculated and displayed.
